        <h3>What are Cookies?</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a
          website. They can help websites remember details about your visit,
          such as preferences or when you logged in. Cookies set directly by us
          are called first-party cookies. We also use third-party cookies, which
          originate from a domain different from the one you are currently
          visiting. Similar technologies, such as web beacons, sharing of device
          IDs and other identifiers via APIs or local storage, can also be used
          for these purposes. For simplicity, we will refer to these
          technologies as “cookies” in this Cookie Policy.
